# VueJS-StarterKit
There are two ways to to create a Vue App, using 
  -Vue Cli
  -Vue UI Grahical
 I have installed Vue developer tools extension on chrome as well.
 
 The information below will be a resource for Vue and all the terms that i have learnt along the way,
 <style scoped>: Encapsulates the syle fo that component only.
 
 
 Using v-bind to binf the props to the components and bind a style class based on a condition using v-if.
 v-on: Used to add events to the components, v-on:click, v-on:submit, v-on:change
